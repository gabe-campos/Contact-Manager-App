# Contact Manager App
Welcome to my contact manager app!
This was a  class project that taught us how to use Bootstrap for formatting webpages, and Node.js/JavaScript for setting up a server.

The app is simple to use after you get it set up.
In order to set it up, this first thing you want to do is clone this repo.
Once you have cloned the repo and navigated inside of it locally on your command line, run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This command will read the file "package.json" and install any required dependencies.

To start the app (once again make sure you are inside the repo), run this command:
```
node createServer.js
```

Now you simply need to navigate to your [Local Host](https://localhost:9001) at port 9001 and you're good to go!

## Installing Node
In order for this project to run correctly you need to have node installed.
If you are on a Linux system, perform the commmands:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```

If you are on Mac:
```
brew update
brew install node
```
